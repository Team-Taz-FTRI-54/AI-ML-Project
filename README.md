### Marek B. Responsibilities

1/ Parse through the PDF and extract all the text
2/ Store the text (locally / database (???) - depends on the size)

- Where to store the files?
- Should we calculate the number of words? / Number of tokens and decide based on the number of tokens?

3/ Figure out what amount of context to embed?

- What's the best way of embedding an entire PDF text content? The PDF could be from 5 pages to 300 pages.
